Why are we doing this?
To create a stand alone aaplication that can run on its own.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to test my knowledege of the different methods, dependences and using different programes to see how i can go around them.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
It all started well, configurations but got some challenges with my testing which i was later able to notice and worked on.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
No comment at the moment as everything was ok.
